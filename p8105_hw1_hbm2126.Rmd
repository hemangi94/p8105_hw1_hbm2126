```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r loading dataset}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r loading libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

### Describing the "penguins" dataset

The dataset has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The mean flipper length is `r round(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` millimeters

### Scatterplot

```{r creating a scatterplot}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x= bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()
```

```{r saving the scatterplot}
ggsave("Scatterplot.png")
```

# Problem 2

```{r creating a data frame}
hw1_df = tibble(
    random_samp = rnorm (10),
    vec_logical = random_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector","that","is","ten","characters","long"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Single","Married","Divorced","Divorced","Single","Married","Single","Divorced","Married","Single"))
  )
```

```{r means of variables}
mean(pull(hw1_df,random_samp))
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
mean(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))

```

```{r converting variables to numeric values}
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
