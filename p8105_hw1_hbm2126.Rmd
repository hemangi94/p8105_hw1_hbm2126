# Problem 1

## Describing the "penguins" dataset

The dataset has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The mean flipper length is `r round(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` millimeters

## Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x= bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggsave("Scatterplot.png")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
